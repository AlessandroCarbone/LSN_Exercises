## NSL - Exercises Delivery

This directory contains the exercises of the course of the Numerical Simulation Laboratory. The course is taught by Professor D. E. Galli of University of Milan.

## Instructions
Each of the following folders refers to one of the 12 lessons composing the course. The directories corresponding to the lessons from 01 to 10 contain a Makefile and return the associated executable (.exe). In the folder "10.2" the executable must be run with the command "mpiexec". Each folder has a Jupyter Notebook file where the
